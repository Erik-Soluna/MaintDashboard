# Issue Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Site Navigation Issue: "All" Selection Not Working Properly

**Problem**: When selecting "All" after viewing a specific site, the page required a refresh to update properly.

**Root Cause**: The `changeSite()` JavaScript function in `templates/base.html` was incorrectly setting the `site_id` parameter to an empty string instead of properly removing it from the URL.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed the `changeSite()` function in `templates/base.html` to properly use `url.searchParams.delete('site_id')` when "All" is selected
- Removed duplicate `changeSite()` function from `templates/core/dashboard.html` to avoid conflicts
- The site navigation now properly switches between individual sites and "All" without requiring a page refresh

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/base.html` - Fixed site selector JavaScript function
- `templates/core/dashboard.html` - Removed duplicate function, updated site status display logic

### 2. RBAC Permissions Issue: Missing Read/Write Permissions for Key Sections

**Problem**: The RBAC system lacked proper Read/Write permissions for the main application sections (Events, Site Map, Maintenance/Calendar, Administration).

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added comprehensive Read/Write permissions for each major section:
  - **Events**: `events.read`, `events.write`
  - **Site Map**: `site_map.read`, `site_map.write`  
  - **Maintenance/Calendar**: `maintenance_calendar.read`, `maintenance_calendar.write`
  - **Administration**: `administration.read`, `administration.write`

- Updated default roles with appropriate permission combinations:
  - **Administrator**: Full access to all sections including administration
  - **Maintenance Manager**: Read/Write for events, site map, maintenance/calendar + Read for administration
  - **Maintenance Technician**: Read/Write for events and maintenance/calendar + Read for site map
  - **Read-Only Viewer**: Read access to all sections except administration
  - **System Administrator**: New role with full read/write access including administration

- Maintained backward compatibility with existing legacy permissions

**Files Modified**:
- `core/rbac.py` - Added new permission structure and updated default roles

## Additional Enhancements

### Site Status vs Pod Status Display Logic
As part of the site navigation fix, enhanced the dashboard to properly display:
- **Site Status**: When "All" is selected, shows health and metrics for all sites
- **Pod Status**: When a specific site is selected, shows individual pod status for that site

### Files Modified Summary:
1. `core/views.py` - Enhanced dashboard view with conditional Site/Pod status logic
2. `templates/core/dashboard.html` - Updated template to handle both site and pod status displays
3. `templates/base.html` - Fixed site selector JavaScript navigation
4. `core/rbac.py` - Added comprehensive Read/Write permissions for all sections

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: The code changes are ready for deployment
2. **Run RBAC Initialization**: Execute `python manage.py init_rbac --force` to create the new permissions in the database
3. **Update User Roles**: Review and reassign user roles with the new permission structure
4. **Test Navigation**: Verify that site selection works properly without requiring page refreshes

## Technical Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing permissions
- The site navigation fix addresses the JavaScript URL parameter handling issue
- The RBAC enhancement provides more granular control over user access
- New permission structure follows a clear Read/Write pattern for each major section
