# Documentation Archive

This directory contains original documentation files that were previously scattered throughout the root directory. These files have been moved here as part of a documentation reorganization effort to clean up the GitHub repository structure.

## What's in this Archive

These files contain valuable historical information about:
- **Bug fixes and issue resolutions** 
- **Feature implementation details**
- **Development notes and summaries**
- **Technical implementation guides**

## Why These Files Were Moved

The original files were moved from the root directory to:
1. **Clean up the repository structure** - Too many .md files in root made the repo look cluttered
2. **Improve organization** - Content has been reorganized into logical categories in the main docs/ directory
3. **Maintain historical record** - All original content is preserved for reference

## Current Organization

The content from these files has been reorganized into:

### üìÅ docs/
- **features/overview.md** - Consolidated feature documentation
- **changelog/bug-fixes.md** - Comprehensive bug fix history
- **database/setup.md** - Database setup and configuration
- **deployment/** - Docker and production deployment guides
- **troubleshooting/** - Issue resolution guides
