# Bug Fixes Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Site Selection Bug ✅
**Problem**: When selecting a site in the header and then trying to go back to "All Sites", it keeps the last selected site instead.

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/base.html` - Updated `changeSite()` JavaScript function

**Fix**: Modified the site selection logic to explicitly set `?site_id=` when "All Sites" is selected, which properly triggers the clearing logic in the context processor.

### 2. Missing System Permissions ✅
**Problem**: No system permissions appear in the Roles and Permissions management interface.

**Files Modified**:
- `core/apps.py` - Added automatic permission initialization on app startup
- `core/management/commands/ensure_permissions.py` - New management command for manual initialization
- `docs/troubleshooting/bug-fixes.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

**Fix**: 
- Automatic initialization of RBAC permissions when Django app starts
- Manual command for immediate permission creation
- Comprehensive permission system with modules for admin, equipment, maintenance, users, settings, calendar, and reports
