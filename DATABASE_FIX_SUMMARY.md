# Database Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
Django was attempting to connect to a PostgreSQL database named "maintenance_dashboard" but encountered the error:
```
django.db.utils.OperationalError: connection to server at "db" (172.18.0.3), port 5432 failed: FATAL: database "maintenance_dashboard" does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The application was configured for Docker deployment but was running in a non-Docker environment where:
1. PostgreSQL was not installed
2. The database "maintenance_dashboard" did not exist
3. The required Python dependencies were not installed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Setup
- **Installed PostgreSQL**: `sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib`
- **Started PostgreSQL service**: `sudo service postgresql start`
- **Created database**: `sudo -u postgres createdb maintenance_dashboard`
- **Set postgres user password**: `sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';"`

### 2. Python Environment Setup
- **Created virtual environment**: `python3 -m venv venv`
- **Installed system dependencies**: Required packages for psycopg and image processing
- **Resolved Python 3.13 compatibility**: 
  - psycopg2-binary had compatibility issues with Python 3.13
  - Switched to psycopg3 (psycopg==3.1.18) which is compatible with Python 3.13

### 3. Django Dependencies
Installed required packages:
- Django==4.2.7
- psycopg==3.1.18 (instead of psycopg2-binary)
- python-decouple==3.8
- django-extensions
- django-crispy-forms
- crispy-bootstrap4
- django-filter
- django-tables2
- django-widget-tweaks
- whitenoise

### 4. Database Configuration
- **Database settings**: Already properly configured in `settings.py` with environment variable support
- **Connection verified**: `python manage.py check --database default` passed
- **Migrations applied**: `python manage.py migrate` completed successfully
- **Initial data created**: `python manage.py init_database` ran successfully

## Current Status
- ✅ PostgreSQL database is running locally
- ✅ Database "maintenance_dashboard" exists
- ✅ Django can connect to the database
- ✅ All migrations have been applied
- ✅ Initial data and admin user created
- ✅ Application dependencies are installed

## Admin User Details
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: temppass123 (temporary, must be changed on first login)
- **Email**: admin@maintenance.local

## Key Technical Changes
1. **Database adapter**: Switched from psycopg2-binary to psycopg3 for Python 3.13 compatibility
2. **Database configuration**: Uses localhost instead of Docker's "db" hostname
3. **Environment**: Local PostgreSQL installation instead of Docker container

## Next Steps
1. Start the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Access the application at http://localhost:8000/
3. Log in with admin credentials and change the password
4. Begin using the maintenance dashboard application

The original Docker configuration remains intact for production deployment, but the application can now run in a local development environment without Docker.
